        <h5>This chart demonstrates how Mr. Ross's frequency of use for a given element has changed over time.  The horizontal axis represents each season of Mr. Ross's show.  The vertical axis shows how many times an element was included in that season.  The checkboxes all you to toggle all of the elements he used on and off.  Each line allows you to examine how his preference for different elements has changed over time.</h5>
